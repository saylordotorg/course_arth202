-   **Unit 2: Greek Art: Classical Art, 480-323 B.C.**  

    *The period that produced what we now term “Greek Classical art”
    began around 480 B.C., with the end of the Persian invasions of
    Greece. A period of peace and unification followed Greek victory. By
    the middle of the century, the foundations of a democratic system
    were in place. In Athens, the statesman Pericles was an active
    promoter of the arts; he began to develop ambitious architectural
    projects for the acropolis. The fourth and fifth centuries B.C. were
    to become known as the “Golden Age” of Greek Art. New levels of
    naturalism and idealism were achieved and merged in the depiction of
    the human figure as well as in the construction of buildings.*

         Instructions: Please watch this 9-minute video, which discusses
        a sculpture by Polykleitos, a sculptor famous for having
        formulated a cannon of proportions that he used in his
        sculptures.  Note the process by which ancient artworks can end
        up in a museum. Pay close attention to the description of
        “contrapposto” and the idea of a unified whole governing the
        sculpture.
