-   **Unit 5: Rome: The Empire**  

    *The expansion of Rome saw the emergence of new building
    technologies, the achievement of startling engineering feats, and
    notable developments in urban planning. The Art of the Empire
    glorified the emperor, but also the state and social structure. In
    the third century, the Empire was divided from within and weakened
    by numerous invasions. In 323, Constantine, the first Christian
    emperor, moved the empire’s capital to Byzantium, leaving the
    “Western Empire” to its decline.*
