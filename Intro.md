Course Syllabus for "ARTH202: Art of Ancient Greece and Rome"
-------------------------------------------------------------

In this course, we will study the art of Classical Antiquity. The
different units of the course reflect the main chronological stages in
art development in Ancient Greece and Rome, from the coming together of
the Greek city-state and the emergence of “geometric art” (around 900
B.C.) to the fourth century A.D. shift that took place within Roman
culture and art due to the growing influence of Christianity. We will
begin by underlining the unity of our subject matter: Rome not only
conquered Greece, but it assimilated Greece’s cultural and artistic
accomplishments. In fact, much of what we know of Greek art today we
learned through Roman copies. We will also explore the development of
Greek architecture, sculpture, and painting up to the Hellenistic
period, when Greek art began to influence new parts of the globe through
the conquests of Alexander the Great. We will also study the ways in
which naturalism and idealism came together as Greek art developed over
time. Next, we will turn our attention to Roman art, studying its
development from the time of the Roman Republic, a period that overlaps
with Greece’s Classical and Hellenistic periods, to the waning of the
Western Roman Empire. You will learn that while Roman art was, to a
large extent, inspired by Greek art, it also developed its own
distinctive characteristics. The artistic traditions of Ancient Greece
and Rome ultimately served as the foundation for the art of the Western
world; these traditions continue to reverberate to the present day.

### Course Information

Welcome to ARTH 202. Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer:** Elisabeth Miller

**Primary Resources:** This course requires you to learn from a
multiplicity of free online resources. The following resources are among
those we will be using repeatedly throughout the entirety of the course:

-   Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker’s online textbook,
    [Smarthistory.org](http://smarthistory.org/)
-   Connexions: Jack E. Maxfield’s [“A Comprehensive Outline of World
    History”](http://cnx.org/content/col10595/latest/)
-   The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s [“Heilbrunn Timeline of Art
    History”](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/itar/hd_itar.htm)
-   Diana E. E. Kleiner, Roman Architecture (Yale University: Open Yale
    Courses), [http://oyc.yale.edu](http://oyc.yale.edu/) (Accessed
    March 10, 2011) License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0. The original
    version can be found
    [here](http://oyc.yale.edu/history-of-art/roman-architecture/).

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course you
will need to work through each unit of the course and pass the Final
Exam with a score of 70% or higher. If you do not pass the exam, you may
take it again. Most units are comprised of readings, lectures, and
videos. Some resources, specifically those from the Open University,
also include activities that will help you assimilate the material.

**Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately **104
hours** to complete. The time advisories listed under each unit title
will help you organize your calendar. Units are unequal in the time
investment they require on your part so you may want to take a look at
the time advisories for each unit before you begin the course. For
example, Unit 1 should take you 20 hours to complete. Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and complete half of subunit 1.1 (about 2.5
hours) on Monday night; the rest of subunit 1.1 (about 2.5 hours) on
Tuesday night; half of subunit 1.2 (about 2.5 hours) on Wednesday; the
rest of subunit 1.2 (about 2.5 hours) on Thursday; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:** Reading the material and listening to the lectures
alone will not be sufficient to retain the information you are required
to have assimilated before you take the Final Exam. You will need to
take careful notes and spend time reviewing. The instructional boxes
accompanying the links to the course resources will help you focus your
study.
