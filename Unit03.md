-   **Unit 3: Greek Art: Hellenistic Art, 323-31 B.C.**  

    *The Hellenistic period of Greece began after Alexander the Great's
    conquests. His conquests spread “Hellenism,” or Greek culture, to
    the Mediterranean basin and beyond.  A vast new geographical context
    acted upon and changed the Greek cultural tradition while the model
    of the city-state declined (and Athens’ prominence along with it).
    The period’s visual arts are characterized by, among other things,
    an ever-increasing naturalism and a focus on representing intense
    emotion through the human figure. Meanwhile, new trends in
    architecture and architectural planning reflected a new social
    order. By the middle of the second century B.C., Romans had
    conquered a large part of Greece, and the assimilation of Greek
    culture and art began in earnest.*
