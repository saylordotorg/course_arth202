-   **Unit 4: Rome: Art of the Etruscans and the Roman Republic**  

    *The legendary origins of the city of Rome situate the city’s birth
    in the 8<sup>th</sup> century B.C., the era of “geometric art” in
    Greece. In the fifth century B.C., the Roman Republic was
    established. By this time, the Romans had gained influence over the
    Italian peninsula by conquering the most important civilization of
    its time and place: the Etruscan civilization. The Roman Republic’s
    art was influenced by Greek and Etruscan antecedents, but it took
    realism to new levels by emphasizing individual traits in the
    rendering of the human figure and face.  *
