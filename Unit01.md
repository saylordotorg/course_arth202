-   **Unit 1: Greek Art: Early Classical Antiquity**  

    *In this unit, we will study Greek art from 900 B.C. to the early
    600s B.C. During this period, the area experienced an economic
    revival after what is sometimes referred to as the “Dark Age” of
    Greece. Along with enjoying renewed trade with other regions, Greece
    held its first Olympic Games and rich traditions in literature and
    the arts began to develop. *  
       
     *The period spanning from around 900 to 700 B.C. is known as the
    “geometric period” in art because of the predominance of geometric
    shapes in the forms and designs of sculpture and pottery painting.
    During the Archaic Period (from the 7<sup>th</sup> century B.C. to
    the early 5<sup>th</sup> century B.C.), Greece increased its trading
    activities with Eastern areas. As a result, Eastern influences
    became characteristic of the period’s art, as did an emphasis on the
    human figure. Archaic architecture is distinguished by its novel
    architectural “grammar,” or its unique combination of structural
    elements and ornamentation.*

        Greek art taught at Santa Clara University by Isabelle Pafford.
        Please view this entire video lecture (approximately 52 minutes)
        via YouTube, and take notes on the characteristics of the Kouros
        as well as its function. The discussion on the Kouros, a type of
        monumental sculpture that emerged in the Archaic period of Greek
        art, really starts at the six minute mark. Because no visuals
        accompany these recordings, please click on the “gallery” above
        to view some of the images referenced in the lecture. Though
        some of these links may not be the specific ones Professor
        Pafford bases her lecture on, they illustrate her points
        well.
